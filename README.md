Healthcare Analytics Dashboard
Project Overview

The Healthcare Analytics Dashboard is designed to analyze hospital and patient data to provide actionable insights that enhance operational efficiency and patient care. This dashboard consolidates patient trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and overall hospital performance in a visually intuitive and interactive manner.

Dataset

Raw Data: Patient records, treatments, and outcomes collected from healthcare operations.

Processed Data: Cleaned, transformed, and standardized data for accurate analysis and visualization.

Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, corrected formatting, and standardized data for consistency.

Pivot Tables & Summaries

Created aggregated views to identify patterns and trends in patient data.

KPI Calculations

Computed key metrics including patient count, treatment success rates, and department performance.

Patient Analysis & Visualization

Analyzed patient demographics, visit patterns, and treatment outcomes using charts and graphs.

Interactive Dashboard

Built a user-friendly interface (using Excel and optional Python libraries like Streamlit or Plotly) for exploring data and visualizing trends effectively.

Insights & Outcomes

Identified top-performing departments and trends in patient visits and treatments.

Visualized key metrics to support data-driven decision making.

Highlighted opportunities to improve hospital resource allocation and enhance patient care strategies.

Tools & Technologies

Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.

Python (Optional): Advanced data processing, analytics, and interactive dashboards (Streamlit/Plotly).

Data Visualization: Graphs, charts, and KPI displays to present insights clearly.
